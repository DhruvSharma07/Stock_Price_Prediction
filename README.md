## Title: Stock Price Prediction using News Headlines and Machine Learning Algorithms

## Introduction:
In today's dynamic financial markets, predicting stock price movements accurately is crucial for investors and traders to make informed decisions. News headlines often contain valuable information that can impact stock prices. This project endeavors to leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze news headlines and predict stock price movements. By harnessing natural language processing (NLP) techniques and powerful machine learning models, the project aims to provide valuable insights for stock market participants.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing:

The project begins by collecting a dataset consisting of historical news headlines along with corresponding stock price data. Sources for news headlines may include financial news websites, blogs, or other relevant sources.
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the dataset for analysis. Punctuation is removed, text is converted to lowercase, and words are tokenized. This ensures consistency and improves the quality of the textual data.
Feature extraction techniques such as Bag of Words and TF-IDF are applied to convert the textual data into numerical feature vectors. These vectors represent the frequency of words or their importance in the context of the entire corpus of news headlines.

## Model Building:

Three machine learning algorithms are employed in this project: Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These algorithms are chosen for their ability to handle classification tasks effectively.
For Naive Bayes, hyperparameter tuning is conducted to optimize the model's performance. The alpha parameter is varied to find the optimal value that maximizes the model's accuracy.
The models are trained on the training dataset, which comprises a subset of the collected data. During the training phase, the algorithms learn patterns and relationships between news headlines and stock price movements.

## Evaluation:

The trained models are evaluated using the testing dataset, which contains unseen data that the models have not been exposed to during training. This evaluation helps assess the generalization capability of the models.
Accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports are generated to quantitatively measure the performance of each algorithm. These metrics provide insights into the models' ability to correctly predict stock price movements.
Additionally, qualitative analysis of the predictions and their alignment with actual stock price movements can provide further understanding of the models' effectiveness.

## Conclusion:

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms in predicting stock price movements based on news headlines.
Naive Bayes emerges as the best-performing algorithm, showcasing its efficacy in handling text data and classification tasks.
By accurately predicting stock price movements, this project can assist investors and traders in making informed decisions, ultimately contributing to improved financial outcomes.
