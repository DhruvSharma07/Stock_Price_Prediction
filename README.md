## Title: Stock Price Prediction using News Headlines and Machine Learning Algorithms

## Introduction:
The project aims to predict stock price movements based on news headlines using various machine learning algorithms. By analyzing textual data from news headlines, the goal is to develop models that can accurately predict whether the stock prices will increase or decrease.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing:

News headlines and corresponding stock price data are collected from relevant sources.
The data is preprocessed by removing punctuations, converting text to lowercase, and tokenizing the words.
Feature extraction techniques like Bag of Words and TF-IDF are applied to convert textual data into numerical feature vectors.

## Model Building:

Three machine learning algorithms are employed: Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
For Naive Bayes, hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the model's performance.
The models are trained on the training dataset consisting of news headlines and corresponding stock price movements.

## Evaluation:

The trained models are evaluated using the testing dataset to measure their accuracy in predicting stock price movements.
Accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports are generated to assess the performance of each algorithm.

## Conclusion:

Naive Bayes emerges as the best-performing algorithm for stock price prediction based on news headlines, achieving the highest accuracy across both Bag of Words and TF-IDF approaches.
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of using machine learning algorithms in analyzing textual data for predicting stock market trends.
